	<p><b>AppAware</b> shares online your installations, updates and removals of Android applications. In this

	<p>And if you like, you can even share automatically your installations, updates and removals on your <b>Twitter</b> account! (You can configure it from '<b>Menu > Settings</b>')</p>
	
	<p>AppAware does <b>not</b> aim at replacing the Android Market, it is rather a companion to let
	you <b>discover</b> new and interesting applications with the help of other users.</p>
	
	<p>Remember to press the <b>Menu</b> button for more features and to <b>long-press an application event</b> to get more options.</p>
